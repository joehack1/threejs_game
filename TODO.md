# Task: Add floor, improve car graphics, and add 3D stars to new.html

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add a large ground plane covering the entire city area to serve as a floor in non-road zones
- [x] Enhance car graphics by adding more detailed geometries (hood, trunk, windows, headlights, taillights) and better materials
- [x] Create 3D star particles scattered in the sky for atmospheric effect
- [x] Fix road glitching/blinking issue caused by z-fighting between ground plane and roads
- [x] Make stats bars smaller to prevent filling the screen
- [x] Add touch controls for mobile devices (virtual buttons for steering, acceleration, braking, and boost)
- [x] Add fire/nitro turbo particle effects when boosting speed (flames/exhaust from rear of car)
- [x] Fix boost particles visibility issue (ensure particles are created and called properly)
- [x] Make stats bars even smaller (140-160px width, 0.75rem font)
- [x] Improve car graphics smoothness (increase geometry segments for smoother edges on wheels, lights, and rims)
- [x] Fix mobile graphics display issue (add WebGL support detection, disable antialiasing and shadows on mobile for performance)

## Followup Steps
- [x] Test the game to ensure the floor renders correctly, cars look improved, and stars appear in the sky
- [x] Check for any performance issues or rendering errors
- [x] Address road glitching issue (z-fighting between ground plane and roads)
- [x] Test touch controls on mobile devices
- [x] Verify stats bars are appropriately sized on different screen sizes
- [x] Test boost particle effects for visual appeal and performance
- [x] Verify boost particles are now visible when boosting
- [x] Test improved car graphics smoothness on different devices
- [x] Test mobile compatibility and graphics rendering on mobile devices
